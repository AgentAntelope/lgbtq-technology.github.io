		<h1>LGBTQ in Technology</h1>
		<p>The <a href="https://lgbt.slack.com">LGBTQ in Technology Slack</a> is a safe, confidential space for LGBTQ people in technology to chat and support each other.</p>
	</div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="medium-6 columns">
		<h2>How do I join?</h2>
		<p>The Slack is invitation-only, but invitations are freely granted. You can request one from any existing member or by emailing <a hre="mailto:lgbtqintech@seldo.com">lgbtqintech@seldo.com</a>.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="medium-6 columns">
		<h2>Who's invited?</h2>
		<p>Anybody who identifies as lebian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, and those questioning whether they fit into those or any of the many other sub-genres of people who are not generally considered "straight". Friends and allies: we appreciate your support, but this space is for us.</p>

		<h2>Channels</h2>
		<p>Slack chat spaces are divided into channels, and we have several dozen set up. There are two you'll be in by default:</p>
		<dl class="line-items">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="small-4 columns">
					<dt><b>#announcements</b>:</dt>
				</div>
				<div class="small-8 columns">
					<dd>occasional announcements</dd>
				</div>
				<div class="small-4 columns">
					<dt><b>#chat</b>:</dt>
				</div>
				<div class="small-8 columns">
					<dd>random chat</dd>
				</div>
			</div>
		</dl>
		<p>All rooms are opt-in except announcements, which is why it is kept low-volume.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="medium-6 columns">
		<h2>What are the rules?</h2>
		<p>We have a simple and uncontroversial <a href="/coc.html">Code of Conduct</a>. TLDR: be nice, and what happens inside generally stays there unless someone specifically says otherwise.</p>
