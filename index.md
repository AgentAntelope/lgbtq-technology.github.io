# LGBTQ in Technology

The [LGBTQ in Technology Slack](https://lgbt.slack.com) is a safe, confidential space for LGBTQ people in technology to chat and support each other.

## How do I join?

The Slack is invitation-only, but invitations are freely granted. You can request one from any existing member or by emailing [lgbtqintech@seldo.com](mailto:lgbtqintech@seldo.com).

## Who's invited?

Anybody who identifies as lebian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, and those questioning whether they fit into those or any of the many other sub-genres of people who are not generally considered "straight". Friends and allies: we appreciate your support, but this space is for us.

## What are the rules?

We have a simple and uncontroversial [Code of Conduct](/coc.html). TLDR: be nice, and what happens inside generally stays there unless someone specifically says otherwise.

## Channels

Slack chat spaces are divided into channels, and we have several dozen set up. There are two you'll be in by default:

* **announcements**: occasional announcements
* **chat**: random chat

All rooms are opt-in except announcements, which is why it is kept low-volume.
