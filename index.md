# LGBTQ in Technology

The [LGBTQ in Technology Slack](https://lgbt.slack.com) is a safe, confidential space for LGBTQ people in technology to chat and support each other.

## How do I join?

The Slack is invitation-only, but invitations are freely granted. You can request one from any existing member or by emailing [lgbtqintech@seldo.com](mailto:lgbtqintech@seldo.com).

## What are the rules?

We have a simple and uncontroversial [Code of Conduct](/coc.html). TLDR: be nice, and what happens inside generally stays there unless someone specifically says otherwise.
